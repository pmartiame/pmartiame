## 🧬 About Me

I'm a first-year student at **Northeastern University** pursuing a **B.S. in Data Science and Biology**. 

I enjoy tackling complex real-world problems at the intersection of computational biology, data science, and software engineering. Whether it’s optimizing clinical software, modeling biological systems, or simulating the impact of public policy, I strive to build data driven solutions.
